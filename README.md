## Project Title: Fine-Tuning LLaMA-3.2-3BIT on Bengali Hate Speech Dataset for Sentiment Classification
### Paper ID: 150
### ABSTRACT
In this digital age, analyzing human language and delivering appropriate responses to their performance ability through text classification systems is very basic. This paper proposes a fine-tuning technique in the LLaMA model in natural language processing (NLP) for text classification, which detects "hate" speech and "normal" speech. Though it was a significant challenge for us to train LLaMA models for fine-tuning with a limited annotated dataset and the complexity of detecting hate speech using a low-resource language dataset, results show remarkably higher accuracy. The dataset from Kaggle, which contains 30k Bengali comments that are accumulated from Facebook and YouTube, including 10k marked as "hate speech" and 20k as"normal speech." For instance, the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) with 4-bit quantization for parameter-efficient fine-tuning enables domain-specific adaptation with minimal computational overhead to improve the implementation of our model and enhance it effectively. As a result of model fine-tuning, our system achieved balanced recall, precision, and F1 scores in both classes to significantly reduce misclassification. The aim is to diminish errors, improve accuracy, and extend the approach to other low-resource languages with larger datasets.
